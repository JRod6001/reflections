How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Narrowed the search.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I speeds up finding breaking changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PROS: control over what is a meaningful change
    CONS: possible to miss a change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Code files are more interdependent than generic text documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat: will show number of changes per file
    git diff: shows the actual lines that were changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Breaking changes become easy to fix.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
