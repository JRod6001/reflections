When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Disaster insurance, and ease of collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A branch is a variation on an existing repository. A clone copies an existing repository onto your computer, and a fork takes an existing repository that may or may not allow changes. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It would help with offline work. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Dropbox would work, it would get messy fast though. The files would need a naming system, and either comments in the file, or a side car .txt file to explain the changes. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Changes in a separate branch would allow for experimental new features/fixes to be tested,  without interfering with the integrity of the master. The downside of branching is some of the complications merging may bring.
